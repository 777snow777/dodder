                <span class="mother">this is a server inspired by Cuscuta.. otherwise known as dodder </span><br>
                <span class="mother">due to its weak photosynthetic capacity, dodder must find a host within the first few days after germinating in soil or it will die </span><br>
                <span class="mother">after finding a host, dodder twists around it and inserts a haustoria into the stem of the host. it begins to draw water and nutrients through the haustoria from the host and its anchoring root dies. it sends more haustorias into its host.</span><br>
                <span class="mother">dodder exchanges millions of mRNA molecules with its host, creating a dialogue with the other plant. it uses mRNA to encode messages that elicit a specific response from its host.</span><br>
                <span class="mother">dodder can attach to multiple plants at once and send signals between these plants. this is called a <span id="dodder-web-highlight">dodder web</span>.</span><br>
                <span>when the health of one of the host plants is threatened, it can send messages through the dodder web to nearby plants to prepare a defense</span>
